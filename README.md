# Example Meteor Blog App

This is a very simple example app that uses the [`ryw:blog`](https://github.com/meteor-blog/meteor-blog) package along with bootstrap and iron router. 

You can view it live at [blog-example.meteor.com](http://blog-example.meteor.com)

**NEW REPO**: We have moved `example-blog-app` to a Github org. Please update your remotes with `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/meteor-blog/example-blog-app.git`.
